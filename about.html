Hi. I'm Peter L. Gilbert. The domain petergilbert.com was taken so I took this one instead. This website will contain random stuff that I decided to put on it :D. 
I'm planning on making some basic javascript games in the future for the hell of it but I'm not sure when I'll get around to actually doing that. Anyways, enjoy the empty website XD.
